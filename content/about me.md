# 🏔️ About Tuan

I am based in **Whitehorse, Yukon**. My life is a constant rotation between the rugged, unpredictable trails of the North and the structured, infinite pages of my digital world.

## 🥾 Adventures on the Trail

Living in the Yukon isn't just a location; it's a lifestyle. When I'm not behind a screen, you can usually find me:

* **Exploring the North:** Navigating the sub-arctic terrain in my trusty **Ford Bronco Sport**. Whether it's a whiteout blizzard or a midnight sun excursion, I'm fascinated by the technical performance of machines in extreme cold.
* **Through the Lens:** I practice photography with my **Nikon D3300**. I hope I can capture the vastness of the Yukon landscape and the quiet moments of street life.
* **The Home Front:** I share my life with my spouse and our high-energy kitten, who serves as the primary "Chief Distraction Officer" during my late-night writing sessions.

## 📖 Between the Pages

This is my digital library. My dream is to write a fiction book that **readable**.

### 🔐 Privacy & Self-Hosting
I am passionate about taking back control of personal data. My current stack includes:
* **Note-taking:** Obsidian (synced via Quartz) and **Standard Notes** for encrypted personal logs.
* **Communication:** **Proton** and **Tuta** for end-to-end encrypted mail and calendars.

### 🎮 Gaming & Hardware
I enjoy the intersection of hardware and software performance.
